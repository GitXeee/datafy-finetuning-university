Is there any difference between interest and Riba?", "answer": "The origination of term interest dates back to 17th century with the emergence of banking system at global level.

Further, it is narrated that \u201cthe loan that draws interest is Riba\u201d. There is consensus among the Muslim scholars of all the fiqhs that interest is Riba in all its forms and manifestations."}, {"question": "What are the revelations/verses in Holy Quran regarding prohibition of Riba/interest?", "answer": "There are four sets of revelations about Riba which were revealed on different occasions:\n                  First Revelation: In Surah-Ar-Rum, verse 39 , dealing in riba has been discouraged in the following words:\n                  \u201cAnd whatever riba you give so that it may increase in the wealth of the people, it does not increase with Allah.\u201d [Surah Ar-Rum 30:39]\n                  Second Revelation: Muslims have been informed about the practice of taking riba by Jews in Surah An-Nisaa: \u201cAnd because of their charging riba while they were prohibited from it. [Surah An-Nisaa 4-161]\n                  Third Revelation: Riba/Interest has been abolished in the third verse of Surah Ali-Imran. The prohibition of riba is laid down in the following words: \u201cO those who believe do not eat up riba doubled and redoubled.\n                  [Surah Al-e-Imran3- 130] Fourth Revelation: In the fourth revelation, Riba has categorically been prohibited in all its forms.\n                  The following set of verses is found in the Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 275-281 in the following words: \u201cThose who take interest will not stand but as stands whom the demon has driven crazy by his touch.\u2019\n                  That is because they have said: \u2018Trading is but like riba\u2019. And Allah has permitted trading and prohibited riba. So, whoever receives an advice from his Lord and stops, he is allowed what has passed, and his matter is up to Allah.\n                  And the ones who revert back, those are the people of Fire. There they remain for ever. Allah destroys riba and nourishes charities. And Allah does not like any sinful disbeliever.\n                  Surely those who believe and do good deeds, establish Salah and pay Zakah, have their reward with their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.\n                  O those who believe, fear Allah and give up what still remains of the riba if you are believers. But if you do not, then listen to the declaration of war from Allah and His Messenger.\n                  And if you repent, yours is your principal. Neither you wrong, nor be wronged. And if there be one in misery, then deferment till ease. And that you leave it as alms is far better for you, if you really know.\n                  And be fearful of a day when you shall be returned to Allah, then everybody shall be paid, in full, what he has earned. And they shall not be wronged."}, {"question": "What are the sayings/Ahadith about Riba/Interest?", "answer": "According to Islamic jurists and scholars, there are around 40 different Ahadith on the subject of riba and its prohibition from Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).\n                  Few of these are as follows:\n                  1) From Hazrat Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him): The Prophet, cursed the receiver and the payer of interest, the one who records it and the two witnesses to the transaction and said: \u201cThey are all alike [in guilt].\u201d\n                  2) Jabir ibn Abdallah (May Allah be pleased with him), giving a report on the Prophets Farewell Pilgrimage, said: The Prophet addressed the people and said \u201cAll of the riba of Jahiliyyah is annulled.
